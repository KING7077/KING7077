### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- **KING7077/KING7077** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ’€ Pronouns: He/him
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a discord bot, named Vladimir, its in 100 servers, not verified yet
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, though I do have some experiance in html, css and some javascript
- ðŸ˜‚ I just usually make stupid websites, some for supporting my discord bot, some, just to code, and think that I'm doing something good
- ðŸ˜‰ Until now, my accomplishments:
    - Made a discord bot that currently in 100 servers (Invite link: https://dsc.gg/vladimir)
    - Made a dashboard(sorta) for my discord bot (https://holypinion.herokuapp.com)
    - Made a url tracker, that shows where shortened urls move to, before actually going to the site (https://url-track.herokuapp.com)
    - Most of these projects are still in development
